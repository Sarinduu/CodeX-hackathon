# GovSign – Problem Statement

### **1. Context & Pain Point**

In Sri Lanka, many government-related tasks require **multiple official signatures** before they can be completed. These signatures must often be obtained in person from specific officers, such as:

- **Justice of the Peace (Sama Wenisuru)**
- **Grama Niladhari (Village Officer)**
- **Provincial Administrative Authority (Palath Palana Ayathana)**
- **Divisional Secretary (Pradeshiya Lekam)**

This process applies to a wide range of activities:
- Registering a business
- Applying for national identity cards
- Registering property or a house
- Participating in tenders
- Applying for loans, and more

The **pain point** is that citizens must physically travel to different offices — sometimes multiple times — just to collect these signatures, which is slow, inconvenient, and inefficient.

### **2. Real-World Impact**

- **Time Wasted:** People spend days or even weeks visiting different government offices.  
- **Travel Costs:** Citizens must pay for transport to reach various locations.  
- **Loss of Productivity:** People often take leave from work to stand in queues or wait for officials to be available.  
- **Delayed Services:** Government workflows are slowed down because documents take longer to pass through the required signatories.  

---

### **3. Evidence & Scenarios**

- **Example 1:** A small business owner must get approvals from four different officers to register their business, each in a different location. This takes over two weeks.  
- **Example 2:** A citizen applying for a housing loan must first get property documents signed by the village officer and divisional secretary, causing repeated visits and long delays.  
- **Example 3:** During peak periods (e.g., election time, budget allocation), officials are busier than usual, leading to longer queues and rescheduling.  

---

### **4. Scope of the Problem**

- **Nationwide Issue:** Affects citizens in all districts, from rural to urban areas.  
- **Multiple Sectors:** Business registration, housing, land ownership, tenders, social welfare, banking, education, and more.  
- **All Demographics:** From entrepreneurs to farmers, students to retirees, everyone faces this at some point.  

---

### **5. Why This Needs Solving**

- Reduces **public frustration** with government services.  
- Increases **efficiency** in government operations.  
- Minimizes **travel and waiting time** for citizens.  
- Prevents economic loss due to time away from work.  
- Supports **digital transformation goals** for Sri Lanka’s public sector.  

---

### **6. Opportunity**

There is a **clear opportunity** to introduce a **digital or remote verification/signature system** that allows officials to approve and sign documents electronically.

- This would **save time** for both citizens and government officers.  
- It would **streamline workflows** and reduce paperwork.  
- It would improve **service delivery speed** and **citizen satisfaction**.  

---

### **Summary Sentence**

In Sri Lanka, the current signature collection process for government services is slow, manual, and location-bound, causing significant delays, costs, and frustration — a problem that can be transformed into a faster, more efficient system through digital innovation.
