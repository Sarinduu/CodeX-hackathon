# QueueLess – Problem Statement

## 1. Context & Pain Point

In Sri Lanka, many government processes such as vehicle registration, land transfers, business licensing, and permit applications require citizens to visit **multiple counters or sections** within one or more offices.  
These processes must be completed in a specific sequence, but citizens often do not know:
- The **correct order of steps**
- Which **sections are open** on a given day
- The **current queue length** at each section
- Whether they can **finish the process before closing time**
- Which **documents** are needed at each step

Existing booking systems only allow citizens to schedule **a single appointment for one service**. They do not provide real-time information about **multi-step processes** or **live office conditions**.

## 2. Real-World Impact

The lack of a process-aware, real-time system leads to:
- **Wasted trips** – Citizens travel to offices only to discover a required section is closed or overloaded.
- **Lost time & income** – Each wasted day can mean lost wages, travel expenses, and frustration.
- **Overcrowding** – Citizens arrive at peak times without knowing wait times, causing congestion.
- **Process delays** – Missing documents or wrong counter visits force restarts.
- **Reduced trust** – Citizens perceive government services as slow and inefficient.

## 3. Evidence & Scenarios

**Scenario 1 – Vehicle Registration at RMV**
A citizen needs to:
1. Pay taxes at the finance section
2. Verify documents at the registration section
3. Get number plates at another counter  
If step 2 is closed or the queue is too long, the citizen cannot complete the process that day, wasting time and travel.

**Scenario 2 – Land Transfer at Divisional Secretariat**
A land transfer requires:
- Document submission
- Legal verification
- Payment of fees
- Final approval  
Missing one step means returning another day, with no clear guidance on optimal timing.

Public complaints and news reports highlight **long queues** and **multiple visits** as common pain points in RMV offices, passport centers, hospitals, and local government buildings.

## 4. Scope of the Problem

This problem affects:
- **All government offices with multiple service counters**
- Citizens applying for or renewing official documents
- Processes that require **multiple sequential steps** in different physical locations

The inefficiency is **nationwide**, affecting thousands daily, particularly in urban centers and high-demand service offices.

---

## 5. Why This Needs Solving

Citizens need a **single platform** that:
- Lets them check if a process can be completed **today** based on real-time office data
- Shows all required steps in the **correct order**
- Displays **queue lengths and wait times** for each section
- Provides **document checklists** to avoid missing requirements
- Allows **in-process payments** without extra counters

For government:
- Enables **better crowd management**
- Provides **data-driven insights** into service demand
- Improves **public trust** in digital governance

## 6. Opportunity

A **DPI-powered solution** can connect:
- **SLUDI** for secure citizen login
- **NDX** for real-time office and process data
- **PayDPI** for integrated payments

This would eliminate wasted visits, improve efficiency, and make service delivery more citizen-friendly, aligning with Sri Lanka’s **Digital Economy Blueprint** and e-Government initiatives.
