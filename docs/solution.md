# GovSign – Solution Overview

### **1. Solution Summary**

We propose a **digital, step-by-step document approval and signature system** designed to replace the manual, location-bound process currently used in Sri Lanka.  

- The system allows **custom workflows** for each government process, including the sequence of required signatures, payment points, and approval steps.  
- Citizens can log in, upload their completed forms, and track the **real-time status** of approvals from anywhere.  
- The system uses **existing government APIs** (SLUDI, NDX, PayDPI), eliminating the need for separate data storage or expensive infrastructure.  
- This results in a **cost-effective**, efficient, and transparent solution for both the public and government.

### **2. How It Works**  

**Step 1:** **Login & Verification**  
- The citizen accesses the system and logs in using **SLUDI** (Secure Login & User Digital Identification).  
- Identity is verified instantly for security and authenticity.  

**Step 2:** **Upload Documents**  
- The user uploads the required filled forms or supporting documents.  
- The system validates the file format and completeness.  

**Step 3:** **Automatic Workflow Routing**  
- Based on the selected service (e.g., business registration, property registration), the system routes the document to the **first approver** in the predefined workflow.  

**Step 4:** **Digital Signatures & Approvals**  
- Each designated officer logs in, reviews, and digitally signs the document in sequence.  
- The system automatically moves the document to the next officer in the chain.  

**Step 5:** **Payments (if required)**  
- At payment stages, the system triggers **PayDPI** for secure transactions.  
- Once payment is completed, a digital receipt is issued instantly.  

**Step 6:** **Status Tracking**  
- The citizen can see the real-time progress of their request — e.g., *"Signed by Officer 1, pending Officer 2 approval"*.  

**Step 7:** **Final Delivery**  
- Once all approvals are complete, the final signed document is sent digitally to the citizen.

### **3. DPI Integration**  

- **SLUDI:** Secure login and citizen verification.  
- **NDX:** Fetch real-time office data, store process definitions, track progress and completion.  
- **PayDPI:** Handle in-process payments and issue receipts.

### **4. User Flow Diagram (Description)**  

- **Citizen Login → Identity Verification (SLUDI)**  
- **Document Upload → Document Validation**  
- **Workflow Initiation → Routed to First Signatory**  
- **Officer Review & Signature → Move to Next Signatory**  
- **Payment Step (if required) → PayDPI Transaction → Digital Receipt**  
- **Continue Workflow Until Final Approval**  
- **Citizen Receives Final Digitally Signed Document**

### **5. Security & Consent**  

- **Secure Login:** All users and officials authenticate via **SLUDI** with multi-factor verification.  
- **End-to-End Encryption:** All document transfers and signatures are encrypted.  
- **Digital Signatures:** Verified and timestamped for authenticity.  
- **User Consent:** Citizens explicitly agree to data usage terms before submission.  
- **Audit Trail:** Every action (view, sign, approve, reject) is recorded for accountability.

### **6. Benefits**  

**For Citizens:**  
- No more traveling to multiple offices.  
- Save time by tracking progress online.
