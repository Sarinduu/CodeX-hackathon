# QueueLess – Solution Overview

## 1. Solution Summary

**QueueLess** is a **process-aware, DPI-powered government service navigator** that helps citizens in Sri Lanka complete multi-step tasks efficiently.  
It combines **real-time office status**, **guided process navigation**, **QR-based queue tracking**, and **in-process payments** into one platform.

Unlike existing booking systems, QueueLess:
- Covers **entire processes** that require multiple counters/sections.
- Displays **real-time queue lengths** and **section availability**.
- Warns citizens if they **cannot complete the process today**.
- Provides **document checklists** for each step.
- Enables **PayDPI** payments without leaving the queue.

## 2. How It Works

### Step 1 – SLUDI Login
- User logs in using **SLUDI** for secure authentication and identity verification.
- Links the queue entry to a verified citizen, preventing abuse.

### Step 2 – Office Selection
- User selects a government office (e.g., RMV, Divisional Secretariat).
- QueueLess fetches from **NDX**:
  - List of sections/counters
  - Open/Closed status
  - Current queue lengths
  - Estimated wait times
  - Crowd level indicator

### Step 3 – Process Selection
- User selects a process (e.g., “New Vehicle Registration”).
- QueueLess retrieves from **NDX**:
  - All required sections in correct order
  - Documents needed for each step
  - Payment points along the way

### Step 4 – Feasibility Check
- System checks:
  - If all required sections are open
  - If there is enough time before closing
- If not possible, warns the user and suggests alternative days/times.

### Step 5 – Enter Queue
- User confirms and enters the process queue.
- Displays:
  - Process map (step-by-step counters)
  - Current position in each queue
  - Estimated total completion time

### Step 6 – QR Code Tracking
- At each section, user scans a **QR code** to:
  - Confirm arrival
  - Update position in **NDX**
  - Unlock the next step
- Prevents step skipping and ensures accurate tracking.

### Step 7 – Payments via PayDPI
- If a fee is required:
  - User pays via **PayDPI** inside the app.
  - Digital receipt stored in **NDX**.
- Supports both standard and fast-track queue fees.

### Step 8 – Completion
- Once all steps are complete:
  - Process marked as finished in **NDX**.
  - User receives a **digital confirmation** and receipts.
  - Data stored for analytics and service improvement.
